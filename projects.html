    Sudhir Memorial Institute is situated in Kolkata. I created this website at Cludo Technology Consultant Pvt. Ltd in the year 2018. It was a template-based work,  
    The design work is created by me like color, font, banner design in PSD, image creation/modification, section design,  buttons, tabs, etc.
